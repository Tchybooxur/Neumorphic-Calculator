# Neumorphic-Calculator
Small project I embarked on to practice the neumorphic UI trend
This is me just playing around with the fundamental web technologies. Nothing too serious. Just casual practice.
Feel free to clone the repo, open with preferred code editor (VS code in my case) and then run the 2 html files in turns with liveserver to see the end-product.
gracias!
